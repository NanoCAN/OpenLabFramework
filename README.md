OpenLabFramework
================

OpenLabFramework (OLF) is a groovy & grails based open-source laboratory information management system (LIMS) 
intended for advanced sample management in small to mid-sized laboratories. It has been developed with focus
on the management of vector clone and genetically engineered cell lines. It can, however, be adapted to cover
other biomaterials. Thanks to a modular structure and the use of grails, new functionality can be added with
little developmental effort. Features currently included are among others: 

* Sample management of genes, gene variants, vector clones, and genetically engineered cell-lines,
* together with information about medium composition, antibiotics and other cell culture conditions.
* Physical sample tracking with QR barcodes and direct printing of labels using DYMO label printers.
* Document management where arbitrary files can be uploaded and linked to samples in the database
* Dynamic web-interface with heavy use of java-script and Ajax with the goal of being more responsive,
  intuitive, and interactive.
