{"name":"OpenLabFramework","tagline":"An open-source framework for sample management","body":"OpenLabFramework\r\n================\r\n\r\nOpenLabFramework (OLF) is a groovy & grails based open-source laboratory information management system (LIMS) \r\nintended for advanced sample management in small to mid-sized laboratories. It has been developed with focus\r\non the management of vector clone and genetically engineered cell lines. It can, however, be adapted to cover\r\nother biomaterials. Thanks to a modular structure and the use of grails, new functionality can be added with\r\nlittle developmental effort. Features currently included are among others: \r\n\r\n* Sample management of genes, gene variants, vector clones, and genetically engineered cell-lines,\r\n* together with information about medium composition, antibiotics and other cell culture conditions.\r\n* Physical sample tracking with QR barcodes and direct printing of labels using DYMO label printers.\r\n* Document management where arbitrary files can be uploaded and linked to samples in the database\r\n* Dynamic web-interface with heavy use of java-script and Ajax with the goal of being more responsive,\r\n  intuitive, and interactive.\r\n\r\nFor more information please have a look at the github WIKI where you can find more information for users, \r\nadministrators, and software developers:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NanoCAN/OpenLabFramework/wiki\r\n\r\nFor more information about our center, as well as for contact details: http://www.nanocan.org\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
